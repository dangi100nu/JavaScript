## uppercase and lowercase.

> The toUpperCase and toLocaleUpperCase methods in JavaScript are used to convert a string to uppercase. However, they have some differences, particularly in how they handle locale-specific cases. Here is a detailed comparison:

> For most simple use cases, toUpperCase is sufficient. However, in applications where text needs to be displayed or processed according to specific cultural or linguistic rules, toLocaleUpperCase is the better choice.

##### Example Highlighting the Difference
>Consider the Turkish locale where the letter "i" has a special uppercase form "İ" (with a dot above).

```javascript
//Using toUpperCase
const turkishStr = "istanbul";
const upperStr = turkishStr.toUpperCase();
console.log(upperStr); // Output: "ISTANBUL" (incorrect for Turkish locale)

//Using toLocaleUpperCase
const turkishStr = "istanbul";
const upperStr = turkishStr.toLocaleUpperCase("tr-TR");
console.log(upperStr); // Output: "İSTANBUL" (correct for Turkish locale)
